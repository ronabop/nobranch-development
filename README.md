# nobranch-development
nobranch-development is to demonstrate common working patterns to never merge branches again, or need permissions to work in somebody else's fork. This repo has three forks: master, newcode, and oldcode. The point of it is to demonstrate why working is an anti-pattern.

Common solutions:
# Why make a branch for an incomplete feature? Use feature flagging.
